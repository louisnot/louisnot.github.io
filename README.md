# FOLLOWER TRACKER FOR MILESTONES
As of 2025/04/23 146 followers

# React + TypeScript + Vite app

Created to track my follower numbers ==> https://louisnot.github.io/
  - I need to build a way to get the number of followers updated automatically. 

Everytime I reach a new milestone the hall of fame will be updated
Be sure to leave a follow on Instagram ==> https://instagram.com/louis.not


# Python script
Not working properly to get the number of followers and META API does not allow to fetch data from non business profiles even though public
  - I tried to scrape with BS4 but didn't manage to get a result
  - I tried with Selenium managed to get it worked 1 time but layoung just keep switching and what works 1 time may not work the next time
Also beware when running those scripts Instagram may block you
